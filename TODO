* load Project config at checksum
* auto detect project type (e.g. pom.xml -> maven2, build.xml -> ant, build.sh -> sh)
* only load configs if they have changed
* rename checksum into should_build() ?
* make the config a python file ! ?
* make sure notification are not displayed that long
* implement some sort of --restart ?? http://www.zetadev.com/software/lib537/1.0a1/doc/html/module-restarter.html
  another idea: by touching a file, flush the projects property
