* cross platform tray with persistent status (green or red if at least one project fails)

* KNotify ? http://mvidner.blogspot.com/2008/06/knotify-client.html
* better django support (make it per process)
  sys.path += ['WHATEVER_PATHS_YOU_NEED']
  os.environ['DJANGO_SETTINGS_MODULE'] = 'wegoeat.settings'
* load Project config at checksum
* auto detect project type (e.g. pom.xml -> maven2, build.xml -> ant, build.sh -> sh, manage.py -> django)
* only load configs if they have changed
* rename checksum into should_build() ?
* make the config a python file ! ?
* make sure notification are not displayed that long
* implement some sort of --restart ?? http://www.zetadev.com/software/lib537/1.0a1/doc/html/module-restarter.html
  another idea: by touching a file, flush the projects property
