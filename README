Nosyd is a _minimalist_ personal command line friendly CI server.

Nosyd is a daemonization of Jeff Wrinkler's original nosy script [1].

Features:
* automatically run your build whenever one of the monitored files of the monitored projects has changed
* support multiple builders (nosetests, maven2, trial)
* notify using Gnome's notification library
* per project configuration to override defaults
* command line interface to add/remove jobs
* persists daemon configuration using files and links
* logging

Usage:
* install in path and run nosyd.py to start the daemon.
* optionally create a ~/.nosyd/config to override some of the configuration
* optionaly create a .nosy file in your project's directory. If that file changes, the file will be reloaded at next build.
* add/remove the monitored project by using --add/--remove [path] options
** you can also do it manually by adding/removing symlinks into the .nosyd/jobs/ directory
  ln -s /path/to/your/project ~/.nosyd/jobs/
