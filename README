Nosyd is a _minimalist_ personal command line friendly CI server, initialy geared towards building python projects (hence the name).

Nosyd is a daemonization of Jeff Wrinkler's original nosy script [1].

Features:
* automatically run nosetest whenever one of the monitored files of the monitored projects has changed
* notify using Gnome's notification library
* per project configuration to override defaults

Misc:
* logging

Usage:
* install in path and run nosyd.py. You probably want to 
* optionaly create a .nosy file in your project's directory. If that file changes, the file will be reloaded at next build.
* add your projects by linking into the .nosyd/jobs/ directory
  cd ~/.nosyd/jobs/
  ln -s /path/to/your/project .
